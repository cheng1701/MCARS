create a new app called events

create a new role called "Events Manager". activate that role with the role management screen in settings app.

The events application is predominately a calendar. 

it is a calendar open to the entire organization.  Make the calendar as functional as possible.

Unit COs and the "Events Manager" can create, amend, change, or remove an event.

A CO can delegate this responsibility to someone they assign to in their unit.
If that member leaves the unit, the CO takes over again.

The primary calendar can be filtered by the unit, sector, Quadrant, or by the whole fleet.
When looking at sector, Quadrant, or HQ items, the user can show just the unit, or the unit's events and their subordinate's events all the way down.

create a filtered calendar section on every unit's page reflecting their activities.
This is for both the public, and editable unit profile pages.

An event will include the name of the event, the people involved, location or teams meeting url,
time and date. an optional image is available as well.  When an event is created, modified, or deleted, all attendees are notified by email.
